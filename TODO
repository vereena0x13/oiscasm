    - more E2E tests
    - flesh out the bitWidth functionality
    - segments
    - linking
        - .cfg config file for linking
    - rename to oiscasm
        - we could use this for not only SICO, but SUBLEQ or others too
            - would need (optional) negative number support for SUBLEQ
    - .ident, etc.
        - to allow generating labels
    - detection and reporting of circular dependencies
        - for example, the following code:
            l0:     .repeat N0 i+1
            l1:     .define N0 l1-l0
          is invalid beacuse it creates a circular dependency.
          in order to know how many times to run the .repeat,
          it needs to know the address of l0 _and_ l1, but
          the address of l1 depends on how many times the
          .repeat is run.
          this is a trivial case; it can obviously become much
          more complex, with many layers of indirection.
