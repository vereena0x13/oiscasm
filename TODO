        - to allow generating labels
    - detection and reporting of circular dependencies
        - for example, the following code:
            l0:     .repeat N0 i+1
            l1:     .define N0 l1-l0
          is invalid beacuse it creates a circular dependency.
          in order to know how many times to run the .repeat,
          it needs to know the address of l0 _and_ l1, but
          the address of l1 depends on how many times the
          .repeat is run.
          this is a trivial case; it can obviously become much
          more complex, with many layers of indirection.
    - get some performance data regarding all the places where we've
      opted to use `asFlow()`
        - the idea was to avoid constantly allocating new lists; seems
            reasonable, but the Flows do all sorts of unholy coroutine
            shit so idk if it's actually better in practice.
            and, don't just look at speed, look at memory too
