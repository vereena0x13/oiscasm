Features we probably/may want:
    - segments
    - linking
        - .cfg config file for linking
    - rename to oiscasm
        - we could use this for not only SICO, but SUBLEQ or others too
            - would need (optional) negative number support for SUBLEQ

TODOs:
    - flesh out the bitWidth functionality
